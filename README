Asset Integrator
================

Integrate assets into editors.

Assets supported:
* Objects
* Geometry Nodes node groups

Editors:
* Objects are added in the object mode Add menu (Shift + A).
* Nodes are added in the node editor Add menu (Shift + A).
* Nodes are also added in Curves sculpt mode (in the menus).

The asset catalogs determines the location of the asset in their menus.

At the moment all the nodes are exposed as new nodes and as operators.

To support curves sculpt mode operators you need this branch:

---------------------------------------

Sample files for testing:
* tests/asset_libraries

Add the individual folders as Asset Libraries in your Blender.
